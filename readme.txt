                    HistoryCal V0.0.7
                    =================

Welcome to the latest alpha release of HistoryCal, an ambitious multi-platform
historical date and calendar calulator.

For more details and links to a compiled version for Windows (XT, Visa, 7, 8
and 10) and the source code, please visit the website at http://historycal.org

The source code has also been compiled on gnu/linux Ubuntu (Mint) and OS X
(Yosemite) although the OS X version is still being worked on. See the file
build/build.txt for a description of the build proccess. I am still working on
producing binaries for these platforms.
