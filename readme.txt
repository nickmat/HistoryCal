                    HistoryCal V0.0.1
                    =================

Welcome to the first alpha release of HistoryCal, an ambitious multi-platform
historical date and calendar calulator.

For more details and links to a compiled version for Windows (XT, Visa, 7 and
8) please visit the website at http://historycal.org

The source code has also been compiled on gnu/linux Ubuntu (Unity and Mint).
A Mac OSX version is to follow. See the file build/build.txt for a description
of the build proccess. I am still working on producing binaries for these
platforms.
