HistoryCal build system.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The build system is created using the Bakefile 0.2.9 program.

I should point out that I have little experience in with either the Mac OSX or
the Gnu/Linux systems. This is more of a "How I did it" than a "How to"
document. If you can improve on it, please do.

The following assume you have the HistoryCal files in a directory called hcal.

Windows Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HistoryCal program together with the libraries and test programs can be
built using the MS Visual C++ 2008 express IDE with the files provided in
the folder hcal\build\vc9. Later versions of MS Visual C++ should work
by updating these files. If anyone would prefer to use the command line
and nmake, please let me know and I will provide a suitable makefile.

1) Download and install wxWidgets version 3.0.0.
   Ensure the environment variable WXWIN is set to the wxWidgets root folder.

2) To compile the test program, download and install the CppUnit framework.
   Set the environment variable CPPUNIT to the library folder.

3) To start the IDE, open the hcal\build\vc9 folder and double click the
   hcal.sln file.


Gnu/Linux Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions worked for me on Mint 14 MATE 64-bit

1) Install build tools
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev

2) Download the wxWidgets source file with Unix line endings and unpack it.
   From within a terminal, navigate to wxWidgets root directory:-
    mkdir gtk-build
    cd gtk-build
    ../configure --disable-shared
    make
    sudo make install

3) Also from within a terminal, navigate to the hcal/build/gnu_eu directory.
    make
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./
    ./hcal
   should run the HistoryCal application.

   I have been unable to compile and link the CppUnit test program yet - any
   help with this would be appreciated.


Mac/OSX Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Still to do.
