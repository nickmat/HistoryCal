HistoryCal version 0.0.5 alpha

The alpha releases are early versions to allow anybody interested in the project to follow its progress. This version introduces the idea of optional fields which makes it easier to extend the calendar variations without impacting other calendars. The Christian Liturgical calendars should now work correctly. The Common Era Julian and Gregorian calendars and the Astronomical Year calendar have been added. The HistoryCal script language has also been significantly extended.

A working Windows (XT, Vista, 7, 8, 10) version is available as file hcal_0-0-5_setup.exe

The source code is available in files  hcal_0-0-5_src.zip (DOS/Win line endings) and  hcal_0-0-5_src.gz (Unix line endings). The source files have been successfully compiled on gnu/linux Ubuntu (Mint) and on Mac OS X (Yosemite). See the included build/build.txt file for a description of the build proccess for linux. The Mac OS X version is still being worked on.
