<h2>Calendar Description</h2>
<p>
 The Julian Day Number calendar is a simple count of days and is the system
 used internally by HistoryCal. It is closely related to the Julian Day (or
 Julian Astronomical Days) but the time element is missing and the day is
 considered to start at midnight.
</p>
<p>
 Note that the terms "Julian Day Number", "Julian Day" and "Julian Astronomical
 Day" are often used interchangeably in the academic world. However, this
 project will use the term "Julian Day Number" (abbreviated <b>jdn</b>) to
 describe the above definition of the calendar and the term "Julian Day"
 (abbreviated <b>jd</b>) to describe the more common academic definition, where
 the day begins at midday.
 Thus:- <code><i>x</i> (<b>jdn</b>) = <i>x</i> - 0.5 (<b>jd</b>)</code>
</p>

<h3>Use Case</h3>
<p>
 There is no known historical use of calendar, although the Julian Day scheme,
 on which it is based, has been in use by the scientific community,
 particularly astronomers, for many years. Its main purpose is as the
 intermediate and standard date value used internally by the HistoryCal
 program. It may also be used as the base for other day count type calendars.
 It is also used to input date values in a HistoryCal script.
</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<table class='record'>
<tr><th>Record</th></tr>
<tr><td>day</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
 Since the Julian Day Number calendar is the same as the internal Cal library
 calendar, the definition is trivial. Days start at midnight.
</p>
<p>
 The <b>Record</b> consists of a single <b>Field</b> named <code>day.</code>
 The <b>Epoch</b> is the same as the internal version, so
 <code>day 1 (<b>jdn</b>) = day 1 (<b>jdn</b>).</code>
</p>

<h3>Script</h3>
<table class='code'>
<tr><th>Default Script</th></tr>
<tr><td
><b>grammar</b> d {
 format pref @(Day);
 alias field {Day day;};
 alias format-number-code {Day ddddd;};
};
<b>scheme</b> jdn {
 name Julian Day Number;
 base jdn;
 grammar d;
};
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
 Although this calendar has no historical uses, it is included in the default
 script because the script itself uses the <b>jdn</b> form for dates included
 in the script for other calendars. This may change in future. It may be used
 to derive other day count calendars.
</p>
<p>
 The script has no dependencies and is the first calendar defined in the
 default script.
