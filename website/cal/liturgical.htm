<h2>Calendar Description</h2>
<p>
 This is a work in progress and the results are still being assessed.
</p>
<p>
 The Christian Liturgical year is a cyclic calendar of feast days.
 It is comprised of fixed and moveable seasons, the moveable seasons
 being based on the calculation of Easter Sunday for that year.
</p>
<p>
 Each Sunday throughout the year is named. A number is assigned to each possible
 week. Because the seasons vary in length, some numbers will be skipped
 in any given year. This numbering system is unique to the Cal library - input
 and output would normally be through the text descriptions.
</p>

<h3>Use Case</h3>
<p>
 The Christian Liturgical calendar, together with Saints Days, have been used to
 date documents, particularly (but not confined to) Church documents, since the
 fourth century.
