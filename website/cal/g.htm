<h2>Calendar Description</h2>
<p>
 This Gregorian calendar implements the changes made to the <a href='j.htm'>Julian calendar</a> by
 Pope Gregory XIII. There were three changes made, a change to the way leap
 years are determined, the year number change date (New Year) fixed to
 1st January, and the removal of excess days (compared to the solar year) that
 had built up since AD 325 (the year the First Council of Nicaea was held).
</p>
<p>
 The proleptic Gregorian calendar follows the ISO 8601 standard.
 The year zero is included, years before year zero are given as negative.
</p>

<h3>Use Case</h3>
<p>
 The Geregorian calendar was first introduced in Catholic
 countries in 1582 and has since be adopted by most of the world and has
 become the most commonly used calendar today.
</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<table class='record'>
<tr><th colspan='3'>Record</th></tr>
<tr><td>year</td><td>month</td><td>day</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
 The Gregorian calendar is based on a solar year of 365.2425 days.
 Days start at midnight.
</p>
<p>
 The <b>Record</b> consists of three <b>Fields</b> named <code>year,</code>
 <code>month,</code> and <code>day.</code>  There are two types of years, a
 common year and a leap year. Years are leap years when the current era
 year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless divisible by 400.
 There are twelve <code>months</code> in a <code>year</code> numbered 1 to 12.
 The number of <code>days</code> in a <code>month</code> varies between 28 and
 31, and are numbered from 1, as shown in the table for the
 <a href='j.htm'>Julian calendar</a>. This gives a total of 365 days in a
 common year and 366 in a leap year.
</p>
<p>
 The <b>Epoch</b> is set at <code>year 1 month 1 day 1 (<b>g</b>) = day 1721426 (<b>jdn</b>).</code>
</p>

<h3>Script</h3>
<table class='code'>
<tr><th>Default Script</th></tr>
<tr><td
><b>scheme</b> g {
 name Gregorian;
 base gregorian;
 grammar j;
};
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
 The default script that implements the Gregorian calendar uses the same
 grammar as the <a href='j.htm'>Julian calendar</a>. It is the third
 calendar defined in the default script.
